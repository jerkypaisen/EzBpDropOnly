# EzBpDropOnly
This plugin converts some of the contents of the box and the NPC’s belongings into blueprints at a set probability. You are now freed from the tedious task of setting probabilities for each item. This plugin operates on the loot table of the vanilla environment, so if you’ve been playing RUST for a long time, you can somewhat predict what will drop from the box at any location.
